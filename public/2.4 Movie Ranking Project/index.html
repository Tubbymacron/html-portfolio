<h1>The best movies according to me.</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time. </h2>
<hr />

<h3>Spider Man 2</h3>
<p>This is the first movie I saw as a child in movie theaters. It also is my first introduction to classical music. </p>

<h3>Django Unchained</h3>
<p>The writing in this movie is just superb. I loved both django and schultz.</p>

<h3>Night at the Musuem</h3>
<p>As an avid historian, and a major fan of Teddy Roosevelt, it was a pleasure to watch this film. </p>
